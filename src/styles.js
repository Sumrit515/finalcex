  // so the truth i have done nothing till now, until and unless i am ready to buy the whole car with the downpayment alone i am not ready to buy the car at all,
  // that was just mind boggling, stil can't belive but this is the truth after all, so i guess i will need to change the decision of buying the new car, and go for
  // the second hand one, as that will be more affordable for me , i mean the 20 4 010 rule has shown me the truth abouth my networrth it's litterally not that much , 
  //it;s itme realize the truth plus my job is not permanent also, i will need to find a fixed income so that doesn't matter what is happening outside the world i should be 
  //able to live and feed my family for next couple of years that means at least 18 lacs of emergency funds, if i include the medical fees then that include 40 lacs i mean 
  //anything could happend at any time in this world, i have already suffered that once, i am not excited to face that all again but who knows what can and will happend after 
  //all whatever happens , happens for a reason be it a good one or bad one. let's see all the best buddy .... i seriously know that she is not good for me, i am ready to take 
  //the every single pain , i just don't want her to come in my life again , the only reason i don't wanted to give her money was because i knew that this way i will be in 
  //touch with her regardless of what i want and now i am stuck and also she has not changed at all she is still the same she was like before the same ignoring one and all and
  // all and all and all and all , i mean some time i feel like what is this going in this world including me you really can't trust anyone in this world, not your friends 
  //family , relations and anything , this is absolutely disgusted to know and be aware of that, and i also don;t know much koi nhi bro , you are you , if someone has change that
  // doesn't meanthat you need to change also, let's accept this fact be the you, you have ever been , nah man i ain't gonna tell her the truth until and unless 
  //she asks me to meet again , look around you what is happening outside this world
